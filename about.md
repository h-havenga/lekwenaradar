# Background
Weather and climate impact every aspect of society. From annoying us on the
road, to loss of live and damage to property. Weather radar is the
quintessential tool for observing thunderstorms in real-time and using this
information to manage and mitigate the impact of this phenomenon. South Africa
has a long history in radar science and currently boast a world-class national
network of cutting edge radars operated by the South African Weather Service
(SAWS) which forms an integral part of the country national infrastructure.

# Aims
This project aims to support SAWS and the national government towards
sustaining and making the most of this valuable resource. We hope to do this by
giving students from multiple disciplines hands-on experience working with this
technology, creating awareness around the benefits and potential use of weather
radar, and lastly to do applied research that could help create products and
services that can be rolled out on the national radar network.

# Partners
The North-West University, and the Water Research Commission has funded the
acquisition, installation and upgrade of a weather radar, situated just outside
Potchefstroom. The Lekwena Wildlife Estate provided the site, along with access
control and security, and Aon-Benfeld funded the communication link to
facilitate real-time access to the radar.
